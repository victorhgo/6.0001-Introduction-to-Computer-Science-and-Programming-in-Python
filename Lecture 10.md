# Lecture 10 - Understanding Program Efficiency

Algorithmic complexity, a rough measure of the efficiency of a program (measuring orders of growth of algorithms). Big “Oh” notation and different complexity classes of algorithms.

## Efficiency of Programs

- How can we reason about an algorithm in order to predict the amount of time it will need to solve a problem of a particular size?

- How can we relate choices in algorithm design to the time efficiency of the resulting algorithm? Are there fundamental limits on the amount of time we will need to solve a particular problem?
